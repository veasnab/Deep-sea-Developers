# Deep-sea-Developers
For our TCSS 445: Database and System Design project, our goal is to build a database specifically for storing CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth) data used in oceanography research. This database will be super helpful in organizing and managing all the important information related to CTD measurements. Plus, we'll also include additional information that oceanography researchers might find useful.
